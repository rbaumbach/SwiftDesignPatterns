# Design Patterns in Swift

Design pattern samples in Swift.

## Current Design Pattern Samples*

1. Type Erasure Pattern
2. Delegate Pattern (This example also uses Type Erasure for an advanced example with a generic struct)

*More patterns to follow in the near future.

All patterns are fully tested using the Quick BDD testing framework and Nimble matchers.
